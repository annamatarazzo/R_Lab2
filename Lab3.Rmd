## Problems

### Problem 1

  The problem for this week is to develop a little bit of content (tutorial material) that could be added to this lab. (6 points)



### The difference between partial and semi-partial correlation

  The partial correlation coefficient is a measure that is used to describe the relationship between two random variables when BOTH of these variables are controlled (or partialled out) for the effects of a THIRD variable. In other words, the effect of the whole third variable is eliminated.

  The semi-partial correlation describes the relationship between two variables when ONE of them is controlled for the effect of a THIRD variable. In other words, the effect of a fraction of a third variable is eliminated.

  Let's take a look at three variables: X, Y, Z. For the purposes of our example, the relationship of interest is between X and Y (so let's call them variables of interest). To illustrate the difference between types of correlation, let's consider the following scenarios:

### Scenario 1

**None of the variables of interest are correlated with Z.**

```{r, out.width="25%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/pic1.png")
```

  For this situation, all three types of correlation  (correlation between all three variables, partial correlation and semi-partial correlation) have the identical value, since both X and Y have nothing to do with Z (@kim_compound_2012).

  Here is an example:



```{r, out.width="70%", echo=TRUE}

# To create a Venn diagram with ggplot you have to manually draw and label circles

library(tidyverse)
library(ggforce) #adds geom_circle

#Data frame to specify circle and text position

data <- data.frame(x=c(0,1,-1),
                   y=c(-2,1,1),
                   tx=c(0,1.5,-1.5),
                   ty=c(-3, 1.3, 1.3),
                   cat = c("Z","Y","X"))

# Plot circles and add annotations

ggplot(data, aes(x0 = x, y0 = y, r =1.5, fill = cat)) +
  geom_circle(alpha=0.5, size=1, color="black", show.legend=FALSE) +
  geom_text(aes(x = tx, y = ty, label = cat), size=7) +
  annotate(geom="text", x=0, y=1, label="Lost Time", color="darkred", size=5) +
  annotate(geom="text", x=-0.9, y=0, label="Cute Cats",color="darkorange", size = 7) +
        annotate(geom="text", x=0.9, y=0, label="Internet",color="darkgreen", size = 7) +
        annotate(geom="text", x=0, y= -2.5, label="Excersise",color="blue", size = 7) +
        theme_void()

```

  For this situation, "Lost Time" part of the Venn diagram will be both, partial and semi-partial correlation, as well as correlation of all three variables (see the table below):



```{r, echo=TRUE}

library("kableExtra")


text_tbl <- data.frame(
  Type_of_correlation = c("Correlation_xyz", "Partial_xy", "Semi-partial_xy"),
  Part_of_the_venn = c(
    "Lost Time",
    "Lost Time", 
    "Lost Time"
  )
)

kbl(text_tbl) %>%
  kable_paper(full_width = F) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = T, border_right = T) %>%
  column_spec(2, width = "10em", background = "lightyellow")

```




### Scenario 2

**Both of the variables of interest are correlated with Z.**

```{r, out.width="25%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/pic2.png")
```


  All three types of correlation are different in this situation.    
   
```{r, out.width="70%", echo=FALSE}
data <- data.frame(x=c(0,1,-1),
                   y=c(-.5,1,1),
                   tx=c(0,1.7,-1.7),
                   ty=c(-1.5, 1.3, 1.3),
                   cat = c("Z","Y","X"))

ggplot(data, aes(x0 = x, y0 = y, r =1.5, fill = cat)) +
  geom_circle(alpha=0.5, size=1, color="black", show.legend=FALSE) +
  geom_text(aes(x = tx, y = ty, label = cat), size=7) +
  annotate(geom="text", x=1, y=0, label="Pasta", color="darkred", size=5) +
  annotate(geom="text", x=-1, y=0, label="Batter", color="darkred", size=5) +
  annotate(geom="text", x=0, y=1.5, label="Omelet", color="darkred", size=5) +
  annotate(geom="text", x=0, y=0.6, label="Pancakes", color="darkred", size=5) +
  annotate(geom="text", x=-1.7, y=1.7, label="Flour",color="darkorange", size = 7) +
        annotate(geom="text", x=1.7, y=1.7, label="Egg",color="darkgreen", size = 7) +
        annotate(geom="text", x=0, y= -1, label="Milk",color="blue", size = 7) +
        theme_void() 

```

```{r, echo=FALSE}

text_tbl <- data.frame(
  Type_of_correlation = c("Correlation_xyz", "Partial_xy", "Semi-partial_xy"),
  Part_of_the_venn = c(
    "Omelet + Pancakes + Batter + Pasta",
    "Omelet + Pancakes", 
    "Omelet"
  )
)

kbl(text_tbl) %>%
  kable_paper(full_width = F) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = T, border_right = T) %>%
  column_spec(2, width = "20em", background = "lightyellow")

```





### Scenario 3

**Only one variable of interest (for example, Y) is correlated with Z.**

```{r, out.width="25%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/pic3.png")
```

  In case of this scenario, the partial correlation is exactly same as the semi-partial correlation, but is different from the correlation since Y is correlated with Z.

```{r, out.width="70%", echo=FALSE}
data <- data.frame(x= c( 2.1,1.3, -1),
                   y= c(-1,  1  ,  1),
                   tx=c( 2,  1.7, -1.7),
                   ty=c(-1.9,1.3, 1.3),
                   cat = c("Z","Y","X"))

ggplot(data, aes(x0 = x, y0 = y, r =1.5, fill = cat)) +
  geom_circle(alpha=0.5, size=1, color="black", show.legend=FALSE) +
  geom_text(aes(x = tx, y = ty, label = cat), size=7) +
  annotate(geom="text", x=1.8, y=0.1, label="Procrastisnacking", color="darkred", size=4) +
  annotate("segment", x=0.2, xend = 1.5, y=1, yend = 3, color="darkred", size=0.7) +
  annotate(geom="text", x=1.6, y=3.2, label="Powersnacking", color="darkred", size=4) +
  annotate(geom="text", x=-1.2, y=1.7, label="Studying for Stats",color="darkorange", size = 6) +
        annotate(geom="text", x=1.7, y=1.7, label="Snacking",color="darkgreen", size = 6) +
        annotate(geom="text", x=2, y= -1.5, label="Procrastinating",color="blue", size = 6) +
        theme_void()

```

```{r, echo=FALSE}

text_tbl <- data.frame(
  Type_of_correlation = c("Correlation_xyz", "Partial_xy", "Semi-partial_xy"),
  Part_of_the_venn = c(
    "Powersnacking + Procrastisnacking",
    "Powersnacking", 
    "Powersnacking"
  )
)

kbl(text_tbl) %>%
  kable_paper(full_width = F) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = T, border_right = T) %>%
  column_spec(2, width = "20em", background = "lightyellow")

```








  The idea behind the partial and semi-partial correlations is to acquire a pure relationship between the two variables. 

  For example, even if X and Y are uncorrelated to each other, it's possible to get nonzero correlation value due to Z, so by removing the effect of Z, we get true relationship between X and Y. 

  Similarly, the significant relationship between X and Y can be due to the hidden relationship between X and Z. For these reasons, the partial or the semi-partial correlations must be used to obtain the true relationship between X and Y.
