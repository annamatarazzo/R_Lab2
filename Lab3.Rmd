## Problems

### Problem 1

The problem for this week is to develop a little bit of content (tutorial material) that could be added to this lab. (6 points)



### The difference between partial and semi-partial correlation

The partial correlation coefficient is a measure that is used to describe the relationship between two random variables when BOTH of these variables are controlled (or partialled out) for the effects of a THIRD variable. In other words, the effect of the whole third variable is eliminated.

The semi-partial correlation describes the relationship between two variables when ONE of them is controlled for the effect of a THIRD variable. In other words, the effect of a fraction of a third variable is eliminated.

Let's take a look at three variables: X, Y, Z. For the purposes of our example, the relationship of interest is between X and Y (so let's call them variables of interest). To illustrate the difference between types of correlation, let's consider the following scenarios:

1. None of the variables of interest are correlated with Z. 

```{r, out.width="40%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/pic1.png")
```

For this situation, all three types of correlation  (correlation between all three variables, partial correlation and semi-partial correlation) have the identical value, since both X and Y have nothing to do with Z.


2. Both of the variables of interest are correlated with Z.

```{r, out.width="40%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/pic2.png")
```



3. Only one variable of interest (for example, Y) is correlated with Z.

```{r, out.width="40%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/pic3.png")
```









Since both X and Y has nothing to do with Z
This would be an example of linear correlation between two variables - X and Y.
